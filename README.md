# MOTORENT Car Rental Application API

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive car rental website designed to facilitate easy rental processes for both customers and administrators. It incorporates a robust backend built with Node.js and Express, alongside a powerful front-end experience. The website offers features such as car browsing, advanced filtering, and sorting, as well as secure user authentication and payment processing.

## Technologies & Packages

The API leverages the following technologies and packages:

- **Node.js & Express**: For creating a robust server-side application.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Joi**: Object schema validation.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For implementing JWT-based authentication.
- **multer**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for uploading files.
- **nodemailer**: For sending emails.
- **pdfkit**: For generating PDF documents.
- **slugify**: For generating slugs from strings (e.g., product titles).
- **bcryptjs**: For hashing passwords.
- **cloudinary**: For cloud-based image and video management.
- **dotenv**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **cors**: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **express-rate-limit**: For basic rate-limiting middleware.
- **helmet**: For securing HTTP headers.
- **express-mongo-sanitize**: For preventing MongoDB operator injection.
- **hpp**: For protecting against HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks.
- **stripe**: For integrating payment processing capabilities.

### Additional Features

- **Generate HTML for PDF email receipt**: Generates HTML templates for PDF-based email receipts.

### API Features

The API supports:

- **Find, Filter, Search, Sort, Limit Fields, Paginate**: Robust querying capabilities for handling complex data retrieval requirements.

### Error Handling Controllers

Refined for clarity and efficiency, our error handling mechanisms ensure comprehensive feedback and resolution guidance:

- **Database Errors**: Address issues like incorrect data types or invalid IDs (`handleCastErrorDB`), duplicate data (`handleDuplicateFieldsDB`), and validation failures (`handleValidationErrorDB`).
- **Authentication Errors**: Manage errors related to JWT authentication (`handleJWTError`) and expired tokens (`handleJWTExpiredError`).
- **Operational Errors**: Provide detailed error information in development (`sendErrorDev`) and tailor responses for production (`sendErrorProduction`), with a global catch-all (`globalErrorHandler`) for unhandled exceptions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this API:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file. This should include your database connection string, Stripe secret key, Cloudinary credentials, and any other sensitive/configurable information required by the application.
4. Run the application using `npm start`. This will start your server and connect it to the database, making your API endpoints accessible via the specified port on localhost.
